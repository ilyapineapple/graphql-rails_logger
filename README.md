##### Without `GraphQL::RailsLogger` your query in terminal will look difficult to read:

![screenshot_before](misc/screenshot_before.png)

##### With `GraphQL::RailsLogger` it will look more readable:

![screenshot_after](misc/screenshot_after.png)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql-rails_logger'
```

And run this command in your terminal:

    $ bundle

## Configuration

By default this gem formats params only for `GraphqlController#execute`.

If you want to change this behaviour, add `config/initializers/graphql_rails_logger.rb` file and set proper controller and actions like this:

```ruby
GraphQL::RailsLogger.configure do |config|
  config.white_list = {
    'QueriesController' => %w(create)
  }
end
```

There is an option to suppress (hide) the GraphQL Introspection Query from the console output. This may be helpful to declutter the console during client testing as these can be rather lengthy.

```ruby
GraphQL::RailsLogger.configure do |config|
  config.skip_introspection_query = true
end
```

The theme can be configured as well.  The theme is applied using the [rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) gem, where all available options can be found.  The default value is `Rouge::Themes::ThankfulEyes.new`.

```ruby
GraphQL::RailsLogger.configure do |config|
  config.theme = Rouge::Themes::Pastie.new
end
```
